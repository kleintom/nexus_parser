# nexus_parser

A Ruby lexer/parser for [nexus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_file) files, as used in phylogenetic analysis in taxonomy.

See the test files for usage for now, lots of examples there.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Make a pull request.
